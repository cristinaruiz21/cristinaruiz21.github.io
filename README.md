Personal Portfolio

Description: My project contains a contact form, a portfolio, and an about me page. The conatact form is for potential clients that would like to use my web development services. The porfolio page showcases my work on webpages that I have done thus far. My about me page gives insight into who I am personally, as well as my professional goals.

Things I Learned: I learned how to add elements to my website using BootStrap. I also learned how to my a website with multiple pages and how to link those pages to a navigation bar. I learned how to upload an image to my HTML from my personal storage drive (not the internet). 

Problems I Faced: I ran into trouble while formatting the footer. I got the footer to fit correctly on the Contact and About Me pages, but not the Portfolio page. I also struggled with formatting the pages to fit a certain way when the screen size decreases.
